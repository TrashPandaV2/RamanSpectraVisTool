# **Raman Spectroscopy Visualization tool** 
Raman Spectroscopy visualization within Jupyter Notebooks, designed with the intent to study peak shifts in PtTe<sub>2<sub>

## How to run ##
Each notebook generates a specific "style"
* Individual Spectras 
* Stacked Spectras

Each file must have it's columns split by tabs 

Line fitting has not yet been implemented
Once you choose a notebook to run, make sure to install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file
   
```cd /path/to/your/project```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
 
```pip list```

Then in the "dir" variable, enter the file path of the folder containing the .txt raw files
